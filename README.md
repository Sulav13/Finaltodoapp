<h4>Final android assignment</h4>
<p>********Features of the app********</p>
<p>First of all, welcome to my app.</p>
 <p>Since there’s no signup option right now, user can only be one and the username is admin and password is test.</p> 
 <p>Once you sign in, you’ll find a add button where the user can add his/her to do lists. </p> 
 <p>After, the user decides to add a list, there he/she will find certain info boxes left to be filled and saved. </p>
 <p>The user can even update the saved to do list as well as delete. </p>
 <p>The lists will appear in three different colors Red, Orange and Yellow as per the priority high, medium and low respectively.</p>
  <p>User can even store the do’s list by just simply updating the list and ticking the task completed box.</p>
<p>And finally, user even has the ability to log out.</p>
